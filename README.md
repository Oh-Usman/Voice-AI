# voice_ai

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a complete voice-controlled task manager with:

1. A clean UI with task cards in a scrollable list
2. Voice command integration through a floating action button
3. LLM-powered natural language processing for task management
4. Full CRUD operations via voice or UI
5. Proper state management with GETX
6. Date/time parsing from voice commands

The app is structured to be maintainable and extensible, with clear separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and services.
